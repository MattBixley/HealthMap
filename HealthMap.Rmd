## Mapping New Zealand Health Data

Lets take some health data from <https://minhealthnz.shinyapps.io/nz-health-survey-2014-17-regional-update/_w_ffcb33f6/#!/home>, tidy it up and plot it onto a Regional Map of New Zealand. The health website is it's own shiny app and we could do a lot of things there, but comparisons aren't so easy.

```{r readdata}
hdat <- read_csv(file="data/nz-health-survey-2016-17-regional-update-dhb-prevalences.csv")

```

This is a reasonable chunk of data, `r nrow(hdat)` lines with `r ncol(hdat)` columns with these headers   
***`r colnames(hdat)`***

lets make a super simple plot with something in the data
```{r}
newdat <- hdat %>% filter(.,short.description=="ADHD", type=="STD",sex!="All")
ggplot(newdat, aes(Prevalence_Mean,region,col=sex)) + geom_point()
```
